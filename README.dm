Requirements
Node
Express
MongoDB


Installation
npm install
npm start

This app is just a rudimentary API  which communicates with two databases. One of them is OMDB  http://www.omdbapi.com/  (you should have your API key and place it in .env file) which is an axuliary database.  As a second one you are free to choose any database. In this case  for the sake of simplicity Mongo DB Atlas https://cloud.mongodb.com/ was used.
Mongo DB connection string is saved in .env file.
ES6 modules are used.

To be improved:  jest tests.  Currently there are some issues with babel. I hope to solve the problem  as soon as possible.
